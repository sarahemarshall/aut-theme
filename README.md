# aut-theme
A repository for AUT themed style files for LaTex and Beamer


Usage

AUTtheme.sty provides command to apply AUT-themed background to various document types:
  + Latex
    - Beamer
    - Report
  + R Markdown  (in progress)
  + Quarto (in progress)


The folder src contains AUTtheme.sty and the folder bgImages containing the required background images. At present the easiest way to use this style is to copy AUTtheme.sty and the bgImages folder into the same directory as your .tex or .Rmd document.  Future project developments include these files as part of package that can be installed through a LaTeX package manager (e.g. MikTeX).

The folder demos contains a range of demo files that use AUTtheme.sty.
